# Cooking Project
We're developing a command line tool in Java to help you plan meals. 

- By specifying what ingredients you'd like to use, the tool will return a list of recipes that contain those ingredients.
- "I'm feeling lucky"-type feature that gives you a random appetizer/entree/dessert
- A search feature that sorts results by price, etc.
- Exports recipes in a friendly, printable format
