<li>Prepare the cake per box directions. Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely.</li>
<li>Prepare the simple syrup glaze by placing all of the ingredients in a small pot and bringing to a boil. Boil about 3 minutes and remove from heat. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Prepare frosting by beating the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl until creamy and lump free. </li>
<li>Add half the whipping cream and beat on low about 30 seconds.</li>

<li>Add half the powdered sugar and beat until all the sugar is mixed in.</li>

<li>Add remaining whipping cream and beat until creamy.</li>

<li>Add the last of the powdered sugar and beat well, about 2 minutes. </li>
<li>Add almond extract and beat for about 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Turn the mixer on high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Assemble the cake</li>
<li>Trim any uneven parts off the top of your first layer by sawing a serrated knife along the top until the top is level.</li>

<li>Place on a cake stand or plate. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with an even layer of the simple syrup.  Trim the second layer of cake and place on a cooling rack. </li>
<li>Brush with simple syrup and set aside. Discard any left over syrup.</li>
<li>Allow syrup to soak into the cake layers for about 5 or 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Spread about a cup of frosting over the top of the first cake layer to about a  inch from the edge. </li>
<li>Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the frosting to about an  inch from the edge of the frosting.</li>
<li>Carefully place the second layer of cake on top of the first layer being careful not to put too much pressure on the filling. You dont want the filling to start to ooze out from the sides of the cake.</li>
<li>Take about 1 cup of frosting out of the bowl and put it into a smaller bowl. This is to prevent the chocolate crumbs from the cake to get into the bowl of frosting.</li>
<li>You dont want flecks of cake in your white frosting.</li>

<li>Spread a thin but even layer of frosting on the sides of the cake. Be sure to fill the space between both cake layers with frosting. This will trap the filling between both cake layers.</li>
<li>Frost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting.</li>
<li>Chill for about an hour to set the frosting.</li>

<li>Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top.</li>
<li>Form an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake.</li>
<li>You may have to even out the frosting in the center by removing a thin layer  of frosting until the edges are higher then the center of the cake.</li>

<li>Add cherry pie filling to the top filling in the center of the frosting.</li>
<li>Chill before serving.</li>
